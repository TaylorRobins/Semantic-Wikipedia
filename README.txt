Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form?
    This allows anyone else looking at the html to quickly understand how the page was orgainized.

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML?
    Everyone is able to work on each others projects with little down time to understand how the HTML is organized.
    Users are also better able to read the content published by the HTML.
What are some disadvantages?
    Semantic HTML only creates static pages.  If a dynamic page is needed than other coding languages are needed.
